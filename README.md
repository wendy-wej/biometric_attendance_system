# biometric_attendance_system
 As part of an exam practical, I made a classroom biometric attendance system meets the following criteria:
- Students must be duly registered on the proposed Classroom Attendance System (CAS).
- During registration, students should be required to provide some personal information (name,
department, date of birth, etc), biometrics (fingerprint) data, courses registered, and a facial
photograph.
- To upload a facial photograph of a student, CAS should allow either <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; •webcam or <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; •enable the user to browse the computer to select a passport photograph <br/>
- The program coordinator should be responsible for registering students.
- The program coordinator and the dean should be able to view the attendance sheet of all courses in
the school (SST).
- The system (CAS) should be able to compute the attendance percentage for each student.
- The heads of departments should be responsible for allocating courses to lecturers.
- The heads of departments should be able to view the attendance sheet of all courses in their
department.
- The heads of departments should not be able to view the attendance sheet of courses in other
departments except for borrowed courses.
- A course can be allocated to more than one lecturer.
- To sign into a class, students must use biometrics (fingerprint).
- Lecturers should not be able to view the attendance sheet of courses not allocated to them.
- Lecturers should be able to view the attendance percentage for each student in a course allocated
to them.
- The program coordinator and the dean should be able to view the attendance percentage for each
student.
- For students who were not able to meet the stipulated attendance percentage, there should be
provision for the dean to give concession to those students.
- If a lecturer decides to punish an erring student by asking him or her to leave the class, CAS should
provide an option to sign out a student that has already signed in.
- If a student was present in class but failed to sign in, CAS should provide an option for the student
to sign into that class, even after the class has ended.
- The administrator will be responsible for registering CAS users (Lecturers, HODs, Deans, etc).
- The interfaces shown to the users should be based on the user’s role.
- CAS should provide an option for users (Lecturers, HODs, Deans, etc) to log in with either a
username and password or with a fingerprint.
